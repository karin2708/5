            <b>Mario Buatta</b> was the one who got away — he never let me into his own house,
            no matter how many times I asked, and because I asked so often he sent me this
            letter with a cut-up Polaroid of his living room on 80th Street. I was absolutely
            obsessed with this room from the first time I saw it in Architectural Digest in 1997.
            Scott Francis photographed his townhouse apartment, and it was everything a cozy, high-style
            house should be. I just wanted to sit on that plump sofa and experience the room as my own.

            His passion and genius for adapting the well-worn comforts of English country-house style were
            snapped up by clients who included Mariah Carey, Billy Joel, Barbara Walters, and Malcolm Forbes.
            He never met a chintz fabric — i.e., glazed cotton humming with florals — that he didn’t like. But as
            fancy and sophisticated as his rooms could be, Mario was a notorious prankster. He would sit at dinner
            and engage you in conversation all while a giant toy cockroach was approaching your plate. The beast
            in question was on a string manipulated by the master himself, and this was usually accompanied by a
            toupee that he would whip out and place on his head and let slip and slide. There were other tricks in
            his repertoire, but these were his favorite go-tos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mario took me out to Staten Island when I was scouting a design issue and we spent the day traversing
            his childhood haunts in Livingston Heights, where he grew up in an English Tudor-style house. He also
            took me to see his favorite house on the island, and it became my favorite, too. It was the 1847 Gothic
            carriage house of photographer Alice Austen, overlooking the water. That day was a gift, as I had the
            master all to myself while he drove us around the island. He told me stories about his family and what
            started to shape the man he had become. I wrote the following tribute for the website Designers and
            Books, published when his book came out in 2013.

        Like a garden at its peak, Mario Buatta’s rooms are always in full bloom, bursting with color and life. They
        are never static or made just to be admired. They are, as he wrote with Emily Evans Eerdmans in his book,
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mario-Buatta-American-Interior-Decoration/dp/0847840727/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0847840727&linkCode=w61&imprToken=rHqqD48E3u4i43s2VezAeA&slotNum=2&ascsubtag=[]c2[i]rhfk6L[z]m[d]T&tag=thecutonsite-20">Mario
          Buatta, Fifty Years of Decoration,</a> to Facebook.
        published by Rizzoli, “living backgrounds, a reflection of where we’ve been and where we are.”
        <br><br>
        In this 432-page feat, a combined catalogue raisonné and memoir, not only are we privy to Mario’s childhood on
        Staten Island as we track the seeds of his showmanship first nurtured by his Aunt Mary, but we get a
        play-by-play behind-the-scenes look at the man who willed himself into the collective consciousness of American
        design by virtue of his talent and astute understanding that self-branding is key to success.
        <br><br>
        Loyalty to, and from the design kingmaker over many decades, Paige Rense, along with other top editors helped,
        but really the book illustrates that his client roster of newsmakers and celebrities including Malcolm Forbes,
        Barbara Walters, Mariah Carey, and Mitzi Newhouse relished rooms that felt as good as they looked.

          <b>Mario Buatta’s Manhattan apartment photographed for Architectural Digest in 1997. The
            living room is glazed in three shades of lime green and creamy white, with a faux-sisal painted floor. Over
            the sofa hangs Mario’s collection of dog paintings. Mario often joked, “These paintings are my ancestors.
            Seriously, I love dogs. I don’t have a dog because I have such a busy schedule, but I love viewing them on
            the wall.”

        Legendarily dubbed “The Prince of Chintz” by reporter, Chauncey Howell, after viewing his 1984 Kips Bay Show
        House room, one might be tempted to think they know Buatta’s work. His floral kingdom is full of surprises, as
        his genius to keep the show from ever getting stale by the many iterations of playing with pattern and color
        goes much further than you might have thought.
        <br><br>

        Buatta is as famous for his offbeat sense of humor as he is for his reputation as the foremost interpreter of
        English Country-House style, as commercialized by John Fowler and Nancy Lancaster, and nothing serves as a
        better illustration for his passion than the warmth and elegance of the decoration of his own apartment in a
        1929 neo-Georgian townhouse. And never let it be said that Mario has ever resisted the charms and all
        encompassing luxury of a well-appointed canopy bed. That is just one of his myriad gifts that keep his clients
        coming back for more.
